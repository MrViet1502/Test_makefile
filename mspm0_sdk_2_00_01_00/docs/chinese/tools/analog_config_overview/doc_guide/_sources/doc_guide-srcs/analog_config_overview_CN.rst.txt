Analog Configurator Overview
============================

1. Introduction
---------------

The TI Analog Configurator is a graphical configuration tool designed to simplify and accelerate the design and enablement of an analog signal chain using a MSPM0 device with no traditional coding development necessary.

This tool is intended to help MSPM0 users rapidly take their analog signal chain concept and create a buildable project that can be flashed to the device.

Using an intuitive 'drag-and-drop' style GUI, users can configure analog peripherals the using the high analog integration of MSPM0 devices.
