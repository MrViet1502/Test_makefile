## Example Summary

The SPI-CAN bridge connects the CAN and SPI interfaces. SPI-CAN Bridge allows the external User SPI device (that does not have CAN node) to communicate with external CAN node. The Bridge device supports SPI to work in Peripheral mode. Initially, User should configure the CAN module registers in Bridge device by sending the External SPI frames to bridge SPI with different instruction commands mentioned as below.
- BIT_MODIFY_INSTRUCTION
- RESET_INSTRUCTION
- POWER_ENABLE_AND_CAN_CONFIG_INSTRUCTION

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
In the example code, the Bridge SPI is configured to work as Peripheral.
Make the following connections between the External User's SPI (Controller) and the Bridge device SPI (Peripheral):
- External Controller SCLK -> Bridge Peripheral SCLK
- External Controller PICO -> Bridge Peripheral PICO
- External Controller POCI <- Bridge Peripheral POCI
- External Controller CS   -> Bridge Peripheral CS
	
The SPI is initialized with the following configuration:
- SPI Peripheral
- Motorola 4 Wire with Polarity 0, Phase 0
- No parity
- 16 bits per transfer
- MSB first

Make the connections between the External User CAN node and Bridge CAN node.

Compile, load and run the example.

Initially, all the MCAN module register configurations in the bridge device should be done before CAN transmissions by receiving corresponding data from User External SPI to Bridge SPI. Data receiving from User External SPI should be in specific Instruction formats in order to configure Bridge MCAN module properly.

For SPI, the bridge device will support upto 8Mbps bit rate with 16 Bit datasize.

For CAN, Nominal phase and Data phase Bit Rates can be configured with maximum:
- Nominal Bit Rate (1 Mbps)
- Data Bit Rate- (8 Mbps)

The following are the CAN Message RAM configurations implemented in SPI-CAN Bridge:

Each FIFO/Buffer element has 40 bytes size (which includes 32 bytes size data payload)
- 4 TX Buffer elements
- 4 TX FIFO elements
- 4 RX Buffer elements
- 4 RX FIFO-0 elements
- 8 standard filter elements
- 8 Extended filter elements


On receiving the "POWER_ENABLE_AND_CAN_CONFIG_INSTRUCTION", the MCAN module in bridge device will get configured with above Message RAM congurations. 

On receiving any instruction from External SPI, the BUSY_STATUS Pin in bridge device will get set and it gets clear once the bridge process the data corressponding to the instruction. So, It is expected that the External SPI device is in handshacking with the bridge device (on BUSY_STATUS Pin) to maintain data integrity.

On receiving the CAN Frame from External CAN node to the bridge, the bridge will toggle the CAN_NEWMSG_INDICATION Pin to give indication to the External SPI device that Bridge device received the New CAN frame from the External CAN node.
