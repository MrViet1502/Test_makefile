## Example Summary

Bridge / translator devices convert between two comm interfaces(CAN, I2C controller). 
CAN-I2C bridge allows a device to send/receive information 
on one interface and receive/send the information on the other interface.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect the CAN_RX and CAN_TX to TCAN1042DEVM pins as described in TCAN
Evaluation Module User's Guide and monitor and receive CAN-FD packages using
another can-to-any bridge project or using a CAN Bus Analyzer tool of your
choice.

Connect SDA and SCL between I2C Controller and Target.

It should be noted that I2C is a communication method that I2C controller control the transmit and receive. 
In general, I2C target cannot initiate communication. 
For I2C target-to-controller communication, I2C target will pull down the IO when messages need to be sent. 
I2C controller will initiate I2C read command in IO interrupt when IO is detected low.

Compile, load and run the example.

CANFD Transmissions to the device will be passed on through I2C controller at 400kHz speed.  
I2C Transmissions to the device will be passed on through CANFD at 250k/2M speed.

For I2C, the example is configured with 400kHz I2C controller.
For CANFD, the example has the following Nominal and Data Rate frequencies configured:
- Nominal Bit Rate (250 kbps)
- Data Bit Rate    (2 Mbps)

This example specifies the I2C message format.
When receiving the message from I2C, the message format is 
< 55 AA ID1 ID2 ID3 ID4 Length Data1 Data2 ...>. 
Users can send data via I2C as the same format. 
55 AA is the header. ID area is 4 bytes. Length area is 1 byte, indicating the data length.
