## Example Summary

DAC12 sends a repetitive signal using DMA and sample timer generator.
The sample timer generator is configured to 1MSPS, so the output frequency will be 1MSPS / (Number of samples).
The sine-wave contains 64 samples, resulting in 15.625kHz.
The DAC is configured to use VDDA/VSSA as reference.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Connect an oscilloscope to check output on DAC_OUT.
Default output will be a sine wave at 15.625kHz with a maximum amplitude relative to VDDA.

On powerup, the DAC pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
