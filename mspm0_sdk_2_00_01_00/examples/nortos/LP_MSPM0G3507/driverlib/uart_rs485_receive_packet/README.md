## Example Summary

This example demonstrates UART RX with RS485 mode. RS485 is usable with both UART Main and UART Extend.

This example can be used with the uart_rs485_send_packet example running on another device.

This example sets receive enable (RE) pin low, then receives a packet of data.
When the expected number of bytes have been received, LED1 will toggle.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect the device transmitting the RS485 packet to the receiving device using the following setup guidelines. You will need two RS485 transceiver boards, one for each MCU.
- Tranmistting MCU 3.3V         -> RS485 transceiver #1 3.3V
- Tranmistting MCU GND          -> RS485 transceiver #1 GND
- Tranmistting MCU TX (PA10)    -> RS485 transceiver #1 RX
- Tranmistting MCU RE (PB4)     -> RS485 transceiver #1 R/T
- Receiving MCU 3.3V            -> RS485 transceiver #2 3.3V
- Receiving MCU GND             -> RS485 transceiver #2 GND
- Receiving MCU RX (PA11)       -> RS485 transceiver #2 TX
- Receiving MCU DE (PB3)        -> RS485 transceiver #2 R/T
- (+) terminal of RS485 transceiver #1 -> (-) terminal of RS485 transceiver #2
- (-) terminal of RS485 transceiver #1 -> (+) terminal of RS485 transceiver #2

Compile, load and run the example. This example can be used in conjunction with the uart_rs485_send_packet example running on a separate device by first running uart_rs485_receive_packet on the device and then running uart_rs485_send_packet on the other device.
