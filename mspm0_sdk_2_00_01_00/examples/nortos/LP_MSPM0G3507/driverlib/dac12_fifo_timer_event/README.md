## Example Summary

DAC12 sends a sawtooth signal using a hardware timer trigger.
The timer trigger is configured to 32768Hz/1/32 = 1024Hz.
The output frequency of the sawtooth signal will be 1024 / (Number of samples).
Since the sawtooth counts to 4096 in increments of 8, the number of steps is 512, thus resulting in a frequency of 2Hz.
The DAC is configured to use VDDA/VSSA as reference.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Connect an oscilloscope to check output on DAC_OUT.
Default output will be a sawtooth signal at 2Hz with a maximum amplitude relative to VDDA.

On powerup, the DAC pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
