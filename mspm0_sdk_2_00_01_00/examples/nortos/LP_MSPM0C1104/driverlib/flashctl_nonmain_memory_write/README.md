## Example Summary

This example demonstrates how to write to the BCR configuration structure in NONMAIN Memory.

The BCR configuration data structure is contained within a single flash sector in the NONMAIN
flash memory region.

To successfully change any parameter in the boot configuration, the application must erase the entire NONMAIN seector.
Then the BCR configuration structure is re-programed with the given user configuration values.

The BCR configuration structure at application startup is configured with the default values.
To update the values, the user should refer to  boot_config.h to view the possible values that may be configured to
the BCR configuration structure.

*Note*: Please use caution before erasing and writing to NONMAIN memory.

**Note**: Example requires Rev E3 or later of the MSPM0C1104 LaunchPad.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0C1104 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau908).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
The flash operations will start automatically when the example is run.
LED0 will blink after all flash executions are completed.
The user can view the contents of memory to verify the results of the write operations.
