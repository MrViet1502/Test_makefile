/*
 * This example utilizes OPA0 and ADC0 to properly condition and read from the on board thermistor of the Launchpad
 * associated with the target device. This example does not implement the proper voltage to temperature conversion,
 * as those equations and method vary by thermistor manufacturer. Comments are placed in code for where to add such
 * calculations to get exact temperature readings. To show case actual ADC readings, this example takes an initial
 * reading of the thermistor, then changes LED colors depending on if temperature has drifted above or below the initial reading.
 * LED Color Code:
 * GREEN -- Temperature has not changed
 * RED   -- Temperature has increased
 * BLUE  -- Temperature has decreased
