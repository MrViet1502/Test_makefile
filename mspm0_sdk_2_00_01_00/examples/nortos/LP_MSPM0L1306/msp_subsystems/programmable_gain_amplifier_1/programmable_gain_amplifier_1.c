 * This example setups OPA0 to dynamically change gain via internal PGA of input signal. The ADC12's Window Comparator mode is utilized
 * to bound the ADC results for GAIN changes. All settings initialized via Sysconfig. ADC120 is used along with OPA0 in non-inverting configuration.
 * Application specific code needs to be added  appropriate maths on ADC results.
