## Example Summary

This project shows how to use the 8 bit reference DAC included in the MSPM0 Comparator module to output an array of 8 bit samples at regular intervals using the DMA. The DAC8 must be buffered by one of the device's internal OPAs before it can be output to a pin. 

After running the code, a sinusoid will be output on PA22 with a frequency of roughly 98Hz.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1306 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example. Monitor the OPA0 output on PA22 to see the DAC8 value updating every 40us. The output will be a sinusoid from 0 V to 3.3 V, with a frequency around 98Hz.
