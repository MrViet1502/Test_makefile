## Example Summary

This code includes many functions for using the different commands for the BQ7690x
family, shows how to configure the device settings, and demonstrates a simple measurement loop.
The code then continuously flashes the LP-MSPM0L1306 on-board LEDs to show the code completion.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1306 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Connect LP-MSPM0L1306 to BQ76907EVM as outlined in following sections.

Import, build and run example on LP-MSPM0L1306.
A terminal in the debugger will display a message to show start of execution:

    Starting Test Sequence with BQ7690x..

If the I2C connection to BQ769x is successful, the terminal will display results
from reading and writing registers, resetting the device, reading voltages, currents,
and temperature.

LEDs will toggle at the end of the tests if the connection was successful.


### LP-MSPM0L1306 Pin Connections

Connection description: The I2C SCL and SDA pins are the only pin connections required between the
MSPM0 board and the BQ7690x for this demo code. Also a ground connection should be made between the 2 devices.

The I2C Clock and I2C Data lines should both have one pull-up on each line. The BQ76907EVM includes pullups to REGOUT which can be enabled by installing shunts J1 and J5 on the BQ76907EVM, marked Pullups to REGOUT. The LP-MSPM0L1306 board also includes 5V and 3V pullup shunts located at J9 and J10 on the LP-MSPM0L1306 board.
