## Example Summary

This is an example of controlling an external segment LCD display via a software method in the absence of a dedicated segment LCD hardware peripheral in an MSPM0 device.
This example supports only a single GPIO Port for segment lines.
Please see accompanying application note for full explanation of example and how to use.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the associated user guide for your chosen Launchpad.

## Example Usage

Compile, load, and run the example.
