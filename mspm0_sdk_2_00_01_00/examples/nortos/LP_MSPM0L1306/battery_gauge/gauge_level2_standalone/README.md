## Example Summary

The example is created to demo a MSPM0 Level 2 gauge solution based on MSPM0 internal OPAs. This solution can self-calibrate the voltage offset and GAIN setting of OPAs and do dynamic GAIN setting to reach high accuracy across low to high current.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1306 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

This example was developed and tested based on MSPM0L1306. Please refer to the related [app note](https://www.ti.com/lit/slaaee6) for more details.
